Advantage 1: Data validation:
FastAPI has the advantage of set the type right away so it can accept or denegate the data type of the information want to transaction.
When we create an endpoint the type of data is set.
We define if is a path parameter, request parameter, query parameter, request body.

Advantage 2: Auto documentation.

Advantage 3: Auto completion and code suggestions.

Instalations:
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
